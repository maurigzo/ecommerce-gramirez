## Conventions

### Styling

  All code must be written using the Camel case style

### Directory organization
  
Each file that is created must be in its corresponding folder along with its style sheet (in case the file has one). Following this, the components should go in the components folder, the containers in the container folder and the contexts in the context folder. 
The images, icons, etc. must be in the assets folder.

### Components

  
Each component developed must fulfill a single functionality. In case of fulfilling more than one, segment it into the necessary components.


## External libraries
